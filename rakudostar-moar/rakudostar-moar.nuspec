    <title>Rakudo * on MoarVM</title>
    <version>2014.12.1</version>
    <authors>Rakudo Star Team</authors>

    <summary>This is Rakudo Star (on MoarVM), a useful, usable Perl 6 distribution for "early adopters".</summary>
    <description>A compiler for the Perl 6 programming language.

The Rakudo Star distribution (aka Rakudo *) combines a Rakudo Perl 6 compiler with additional resources including a selection of modules.

Rakudo Star is meant for those who wish to explore what’s possible with Rakudo Perl 6 and provide feedback on what works, what doesn’t, and what else they would like to see included in the Rakudo Star distribution.

This chocolatey package defaults to the MoarVM but if you want to download Rakudo * for ParrotVM then you just need to type `cinst rakudo.parrot`.</description>
