    <summary>This is Rakudo Star (on ParrotVM), a useful, usable Perl 6 distribution for "early adopters".</summary>
    <description>A compiler for the Perl 6 programming language.

The Rakudo Star distribution (aka Rakudo *) combines a Rakudo Perl 6 compiler with additional resources including a selection of modules.

Rakudo Star is meant for those who wish to explore what’s possible with Rakudo Perl 6 and provide feedback on what works, what doesn’t, and what else they would like to see included in the Rakudo Star distribution.</description>

    <releaseNotes>Some of the new compiler features added to this release include:

- $str ~~ s/// now returns a Match or list of Matches (incompatible change)
- Supply.lines/words and IO::Handle.words implemented
- &indir for scoped directory manipulations
- Various performance improvements
- Method 'for' as an alias for 'map'. Map will stop flattening the list eventually, 'for' remains as it is now
- Method 'unique' as a successor for 'uniq'
- Introduce IO::Handle.slurp-rest for slurping rest from the handle
- Fix tie-breaking issues with longest literal matching
- Method FALLBACK implemented
- $\*DISTRO and $\*KERNEL updated ($*DISTRO now actually report the Linux dist)
- Added Metamodel::Primitives, to open up more meta-programming possibilities
  (publishing method caches, completely custom meta-objects, etc.)

Changes to modules included in Rakudo Star:

- [Bailador](https://github.com/tadzik/Bailador) now binds to all interfaces by default.
- [panda](https://github.com/tadzik/panda) reads package information from http://ecosystem-api.p6c.org/ as opposed to http://feather.perl6.nl:3000/ .
- panda executable now works under PowerShell.
- panda returns correct exit status if it fails.
- panda now ignores POD while determining module dependencies.
- panda now can [upload test results to testers.perl6.org server](http://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2014/12/21/day-21-community-smoke-testing/).
- panda now displays help with correct command descriptions when using `--help`.
- panda has a `smoke` option to download and test all Perl 6 modules.
- panda can now use `look` option in order to download modules without doing anything else.
- [HTTP::Easy](https://github.com/supernovus/perl6-http-easy) has received a few algorithm optimizations that made it faster.
- HTTP::Easy now binds to all interfaces by default when acting as a web server.
- [ufo](https://github.com/masak/ufo) now leaves `.pm` and `.pm6` in module names.
- [NativeCall](https://github.com/jnthn/zavolaj) now parses library names like `libfoo-2.0` and `libbar.so.3.3.0`.

New in ParrotVM version 6.9.0:

    - Core
        + Changed behavior with illegal escape sequences, GH #1103. Do not silently
          skip the \ anymore, throw an EXCEPTION_INVALID_CHARACTER error with
          "Illegal escape sequence \o in 'string\o'".
        + Add platform encoding functions for darwin, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD,
          fixing rakudo problems with UTF-8 locales. #1092
        + Enable trap op (int3) on x86_64 also
        + Add const to env api STRING args
        + Do no pre-allocate 256 IO tables for the standard handles, only 3. #1093
        + Renamed ops2c to parrot-ops2c. Get the new name if exists in config
          key ops2c. #900
        + Reenable parrot -t [flags] traceflags to enable the flags 2 find_method and
          4 invoke/retcc/yield again.
        + Enable >2GB RAM on darwin also. #268
        + Fix crash with parrot -d8 DEBUG_IMC dump_instructions
        + Fix sprintf width count for unicode strings. #956
        + Fix sprintf width for NaN/Inf/-Inf [GH #1099/perl6 RT#116280]
        + Optimize utf8_substr. Do not use the slow utf8 iterator.
        + Regenerated and fixed the iso_8859_1_typetable. Add \x2028, \x2029
          and \v to be of cclass newline. [GH #1086, perl6 RT #122341].
          Several chars 160..191 are not in the [[:punct:]] class anymore.
          Removed defunct Parrot_ascii_typetable, unused since 2010.
        + Protect callmethod from an empty object, missed by fixup_subs
          immediate. #1024
        + Add Couroutine reset and autoreset methods. #564
        + Add -t8 trace flag for Coroutine states
        + Disabled trace flags -t4 and -t8 with --optimize. #1105
        + Harmonize parrot usage messages
    - Build
        + Fix all -Wshadow instances
        + Added bootstrap-tables make target
        + Configure options consistency: --{en,dis}able- for shared, rpath,
          threads, --with{,out}- for: llvm pcre ... + threads. [GH #1101]
        + Deprecated --parrot_is_shared in favor of --enable-shared. [GH #1101]
        + Change default of the config key debugging from 1 to 0, i.e. you need to
          provide now --debugging[=flags] for debugging. [GH #1099]
        + Enable --disable-shared (or --parrot_is_shared=0) to link against static
          libparrot [GH #1101]
    - Documentation
        + Add missing manpages for pbc_disassemble, pbc_dump, pbc_merge
        + Improved src/string/encoding/tables.c pod.
    - Tests
        + Run fulltests with the runcore=fast,-O1,-O2 fast, without -D040, --gc-debug
          [GH #1086]
        + Added tests for LexInfo.declare_lex_preg and .lex quoting roundtrips
          [GH #1095]
        + Simplify smolder resend usage
