    <summary>This is Rakudo Star, a useful, usable Perl 6 distribution for "early adopters".</summary>
    <description>A compiler for the Perl 6 programming language.

The Rakudo Star distribution (aka Rakudo *) combines a Rakudo Perl 6 compiler with additional resources including a selection of modules.

Rakudo Star is meant for those who wish to explore what’s possible with Rakudo Perl 6 and provide feedback on what works, what doesn’t, and what else they would like to see included in the Rakudo Star distribution.

This chocolatey package defaults to the MoarVM.</description>
