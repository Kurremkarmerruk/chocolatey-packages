    <summary>This is Rakudo Star, a useful, usable Perl 6 distribution for "early adopters".</summary>
    <description>A compiler for the Perl 6 programming language.

The Rakudo Star distribution (aka Rakudo *) combines a Rakudo Perl 6 compiler with additional resources including a selection of modules.

Rakudo Star is meant for those who wish to explore what’s possible with Rakudo Perl 6 and provide feedback on what works, what doesn’t, and what else they would like to see included in the Rakudo Star distribution.

This chocolatey package defaults to the MoarVM.</description>

    <releaseNotes>Some of the new compiler features added to this release include:

- $str ~~ s/// now returns a Match or list of Matches (incompatible change)
- Supply.lines/words and IO::Handle.words implemented
- indir for scoped directory manipulations
- Various performance improvements
- Method 'for' as an alias for 'map'. Map will stop flattening the list eventually, 'for' remains as it is now
- Method 'unique' as a successor for 'uniq'
- Introduce IO::Handle.slurp-rest for slurping rest from the handle
- Fix tie-breaking issues with longest literal matching
- Method FALLBACK implemented
- $\*DISTRO and $\*KERNEL updated ($*DISTRO now actually report the Linux dist)
- Added Metamodel::Primitives, to open up more meta-programming possibilities
  (publishing method caches, completely custom meta-objects, etc.)

Changes to modules included in Rakudo Star:

- [Bailador](https://github.com/tadzik/Bailador) now binds to all interfaces by default.
- [panda](https://github.com/tadzik/panda) reads package information from http://ecosystem-api.p6c.org/ as opposed to http://feather.perl6.nl:3000/ .
- panda executable now works under PowerShell.
- panda returns correct exit status if it fails.
- panda now ignores POD while determining module dependencies.
- panda now can [upload test results to testers.perl6.org server](http://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2014/12/21/day-21-community-smoke-testing/).
- panda now displays help with correct command descriptions when using `--help`.
- panda has a `smoke` option to download and test all Perl 6 modules.
- panda can now use `look` option in order to download modules without doing anything else.
- [HTTP::Easy](https://github.com/supernovus/perl6-http-easy) has received a few algorithm optimizations that made it faster.
- HTTP::Easy now binds to all interfaces by default when acting as a web server.
- [ufo](https://github.com/masak/ufo) now leaves `.pm` and `.pm6` in module names.
- [NativeCall](https://github.com/jnthn/zavolaj) now parses library names like `libfoo-2.0` and `libbar.so.3.3.0`.
